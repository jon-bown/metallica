# Metallica Kaggle Data

The purpose of this repository is to maintain Metallica datasets and notebooks on Kaggle.

# Songs Dataset

The `song-data` folder contains an up-to-date compliation of Metallica songs from the Spotify API. A scheduled workflow runs on the 1st of every month to check for updates. If updates are made, Kaggle is updated via the Kaggle API. The 'popularity' feature is really the only column that will change over time unless new songs are added.
